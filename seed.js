// this is basically how we can strip what we need from an API

// 1. fetch api and write it to a JSON file after stringifying it as a JSON
// 2. Create a Schema that you want to follow with the portions of the API data
// 3. Create a seed file in which you use the schema structure, import the data you wrote in step one
// 4. Map that data out into a new variable
// 5. put that into a new database
